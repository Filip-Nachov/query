### ***A simple lightweight, C++ based terminal utility for searching text efficiently in Linux environments.***


# Installation and Build üõ†Ô∏è
requirements:
- git 
- make
- g++

### Windows:
If you are using Windows, sadly you won't be able to install it directly on the Windows terminal (cmd, PowerShell, etc) unless you have G++, make, and git on your Windows but this is still not recommended because in my experience g++ and make file don't work the best on windows if you manage to install g++ and make while making them work then you will  have to clone the library with:
```
git clone https://github.com/Filip-Nachov/query.git
cd query
make
```
and then put the query executable in the path
There is still another way that is recommended and that is with a WSL if you do have a WSL already installed go to the Linux way to install it.

### Mac/Os and Linux
This way is way easier and it is recommended to do it like this you will still need git, make, and g++ but luckily it is proven to work in my experience. To do it on linux or macOS run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Filip-Nachov/query.git
cd query
make
sudo make install
```
