### ***A simple lightweight, C++ based terminal utility for searching text efficiently in Linux environments.***


# Installation and Build üõ†Ô∏è
### requirements:
- git 
- make
- g++

### Windows:
If you are using Windows, there are 2 ways to do this the first way and the way disadvise you to take is directly installing it on one of the Windows shells exp. cmd, PowerShell and etc. The reasoning is that the cpp compiler and the makefile, as well as the env path, are different than on Linux or Macintosh, this way is definitely harder but can be more awarding if you use the Windows shells more but it is good to remember that this way might not be for a beginner. The Windows way you have to make the g++ compiler work on Windows which has been an awful experience for me and other people I know, same with the makefile as these tools aren't meant for Windows and you have to have a solid understanding of the path environment to put it there, but if you do manage to install and make the g++ compiler as well as the makefile working while knowing enough about path variables and having git installed then you can just run the following commands in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Filip-Nachov/query.git
cd query
make
```
and then put the query executable in the path
There is still another way that is recommended and that is with a WSL if you do have a WSL already installed go to the Linux way to install it.

### Mac/Os and Linux
This way is way easier and it is recommended to do it like this you will still need git, make, and g++ but luckily it is proven to work in my experience. To do it on Linux or macOS run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Filip-Nachov/query.git
cd query
make
sudo make install
```
